I have developed an application that recommends activities based on the weather for people living in Istanbul. In the first stage, it asks for your name, surname, and age. If you are under 10 years old, the application does not accept you. Then, it recommends activities such as going to the library, staying at home, shopping, and going to the park based on the weather temperature, which is retrieved from a real-time API.

You can run the project using the following commands:


dfx start --background
dfx deploy
